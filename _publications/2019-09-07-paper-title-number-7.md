Although two previous studies have already suggested that EBS on human early visual cortex could effectively induce color perceptual, the current study has systematically measured the color preference in local neuron ensembles using both intracranial electrical brain stimulation and visual evoked potential within the same RF. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1D, the color preference in X1 was spatially organized in the local RF, which is consistent with the hue map in non-human primatesâ€™ V2. Moreover, the unidirectional connectivity from V2 to VOTC may play a critical role in color awareness.
