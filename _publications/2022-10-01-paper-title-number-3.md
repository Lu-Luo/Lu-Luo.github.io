In our study, we employed a cutting-edge technique called cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) to investigate the spectral profiles of functional connectivities within the human visual cortex. By applying microdoses of electrical stimulation directly to the cortex, we elicited cortical responses in interconnected areas. Subsequently, we examined the spectral characteristics of these responses, leading to intriguing findings. We found that short-range connections between V1 and V2/V3 were primarily supported by the gamma rhythm; on the other hand, long-range connections between V1 and higher visual areas were predominantly modulated by the theta rhythm.
